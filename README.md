# lf_benchmark_traces

JSON files for the Chrome trace viewer are too large, thus, not all of them is included in the repository.

To convert the `.lft` files into JSON files for the Chrome trace viewer, run

`trace_to_chrome [filename]` (No need to include `.lft` extension.)

And open the Chrome browser and type `chrome://tracing/` in the address bar.

Then open the JSON file created.
